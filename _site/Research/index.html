The overarching objective of my research is to establish provably safe performance capabilities for nonlinear systems under significant uncertainties. 
My Ph.D. thesis mainly involves developing a novel control algorithm starting from its core mathematical underpinnings that is capable of navigating a nonlinear system to a provably
reachable state within a guaranteed set amount of time without knowledge of the system dynamics. We aptly call said algorithm Reachable Predictive Control (RPC). To demonstrate the 
algorithm's efficacy, I am currently applying RPC onto an autonomous vehicle with the objective of successfully navigating around obstacles to reach some final state 
within a theoretically guaranteed timeframe without the use of a dynamic model.
</p>
<!--p>
In addition to previous developments and the application of RPC, current research efforts involve: (1) the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model and control a two-segmented soft 
robotic manipulator and (2) the incorporation of observable trajectories to RPC for system identification and control using Koopman learning methods. Both efforts fall under
the category of control under significant uncertainties. For (1): due to the lack of reliable dynamic models for soft robots, and for (2): the lack of dynamic model needed to control a nonlinear system 
using Koopman learning methods.

    RPC works as follows: (1) <b>Resilience Verification:</b> determine if current robust and adaptive control methods would provide sufficient
    autonomous capabilities to achieve the control objective; if not, (2) <b>Active Learning:</b> execute a learning cycle to learn the dynamics
    locally; (3) <b>Resilient Task Assignment:</b> determine a guaranteed set of reachable states without knowledge of the system dynamics; (4)
    <b>Controller Synthesis:</b> synthesize control action based on the limited knowledge from active learning and resilient task assignment; (5)
    repeat steps (2)-(4) to iteratively navigate to a provably reachable location without knowledge of the true system dynamics. Below is a list
    of relevant publications for RPC.

    We consider nonlinear control-affine systems of the form $$\dot{x} = f(x) + G(x)u,\quad x(0) = x_0$$ where $u\in\mathbb{B}^m(0;1)$ and $f, G$ are unknown and represent the drift and the control input vector field respectively.
    When implementing RPC, the system initially undergoes a <a href="/assets/PDFs/Online_Learning_and_Control_Synthesis_for_Reachable_Paths_of_Unknown_Nonlinear_Systems_v1.pdf" target="_blank">learning cycle</a>
    where m+1 excitations to its actuators provide the local dynamics around $x = x_0$. The system performs <a href="/assets/PDFs/Reachability_of_Nonlinear_Systems_with_Unknown_Dynamics.pdf" target="_blank" >resilient task assignment</a>, 
    where it will autonomously calculate a guaranteed underapproximation of the true reachable set of our unknown system using (i) local dynamics from active learning, and (ii) the growth rate on the bounds of those dynamics
    gathered from known physical laws -- the following <a href="/assets/PDFs/On_the_Minimax_Reachability_of_Target_Sets_and_Target_Tubes.pdf" target="_blank">reference</a> is provided for additional background 
    on reachability analysis. We refer to this underapproximated set as the <i>Guaranteed Reachable Set (GRS)</i>, which naturally translates to a set of states we can provably reach within a given timeframe without knowledge of     
    system dynamics. We provide an illustration of resilient task assignment below.

  <p>
    We discuss in <a href="/assets/PDFs/Reachability_of_Nonlinear_Systems_with_Unknown_Dynamics.pdf" target="_blank" >this paper</a> how, in the case of nonlinear control-affine systems, this problem is mathematically equivalent to characterizing 
    a set contained in the interior of an intersection of infinitely many ellipses to ultimately calculate the GRS. The animation above shows the blue borders of infinitely many ellipses and black borders of finitely many ellipses and
    how the interior of their intersections are equivalent. In <a href="/assets/PDFs/Maximal_Ellipsoid_Method_for_Guaranteed_Reachability_of_Unknown_Fully_Actuated_Systems.pdf" target="_blank" >this paper</a>, we formally
    prove this to be true and show how their equivalent interiors allow us to implement <a href="/assets/PDFs/bv_cvxbook.pdf" target="_blank" >optimization theory</a> to calculate a maximally inscribed ellipsoid (shown in red), 
    ultimately resulting in a maximal set of real-time reachable states. Results were also recently generalized to any system existing on complete <a href="/assets/PDFs/Guaranteed_Reachability_on_Riemannian_Manifolds_for_Unknown_Nonlinear_Systems_v1.pdf" target="_blank" >Riemannian manifolds</a> 
    for improved capabilities and a wider range of practical applications.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Existing publications pertaining to controller synthesis detail how we can: (1)
<a href="/assets/PDFs/Identifying_Single_Input_Linear_System_Dynamics_from_Reachable_Sets.pdf" target="_blank" >use reachable sets to uniquely determine the system dynamics of an unknown system</a>
    and (2) <a href="/assets/PDFs/Online_Learning_and_Control_Synthesis_for_Reachable_Paths_of_Unknown_Nonlinear_Systems_v1.pdf" target="_blank">synthesize control action using theoretical guarantees from resilient task assignment</a>.
    Current efforts build on (2), where we use the set of reachable states from resilient task assignment to synthesize control action. 
    Specifically, efforts focus on implementing Reachable Predictive Control to navigate an autonomous vehicle around obstacles to a desired target state within a theoretically
    guaranteed amount of time without the use of the vehicle's dynamics model.
